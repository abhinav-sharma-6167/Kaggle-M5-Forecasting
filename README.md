The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.
